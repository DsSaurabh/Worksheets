Q11 to Q13 are subjective questions, answer them briefly

11. Differentiate between a list, tuple, set and dictionary.

Answer) Lists:--> In Python list is a sequence of values called items or elements. The elements can be of any type. The list is a datatype available in python which 
                  can be written as a list of comma seprated values (items) between square brackets []. List are mutable.
       
Tuple:--> Tuple is a collection of python objects much like lists. Values of a tuples are seprated by commas. The main characteristics are:
           a) It is immutable sequence in python.
           b) It is define under parenthesis ().
           c) It can store any type of elements

Sets:--> A set is an unorderd collection of unique elements without duplicates. 
         Set is mutable and it is define under curly brackets{}.

Dictianary:-->Dictianary is unordered collection. It store values in keys and values form. The sequence of such key and value pairs is seprated by commas.
              The pairs are called items. All these items are enclosed in curly brackets {}. A colon seprate a key and its value. 
              Dictianary objects are mutable.

12. Are strings mutable in python? Suppose you have a string “I+Love+Python”, write a small code to replace ‘+’ with space in python.

Answer) No strings are not mutable. It is immutable means once the string is created it's values cannot be changed or modified.

       str1 = "I+LOVE+PYTHON"
       str2 = str1.replace("+"," ")
       print(str2)

13. What does the function ord() do in python? Explain with example. Also, write down the function for getting the datatype of a variable in python.

Answer) ord() is a built in function in python to return the ASCII value for a given character.
        Example: ord('A') #Return ASCII value of character 'A'
                Output: 65
                
                ord('a') #Return ASCII value of character 'a'
                Output: 97
    
       To check the type of any variable datatype, we can use type() function. It will return the type of mentioned variable data type.
